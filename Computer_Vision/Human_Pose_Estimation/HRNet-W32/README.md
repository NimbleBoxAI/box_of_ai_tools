# HRNet-W32

Original [Repo](https://github.com/HRNet/HigherHRNet-Human-Pose-Estimation) and you can get weights from [GDrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1X9-TzWpwbX2zQf2To8lB-ZQHMYviYYh6?usp=sharing).

To run the model you need to spend a little bit of time understanding the code, please read the original repo before modifying. The current version works perfectly for `coco_hrnet_w32_512`.
